Over the moths our contribution took place, we encountered many difficulties and challenges to overcome. The new features to be implemented
required to modify in great depth the entire code base. From node versioning to unchained randomness and multi beacon support , each new feature 
added was even more challenging. It took several months to finish the work, but at the end, the three of them were completed, as well as many other
minor general improvements that contribute to an easier and more flexible application. 

Our contribution got released on the Drand v1.4.0 for testnet. If you desire to check it, please refer to [:link:](https://github.com/drand/drand/releases/tag/v1.4.0-testnet)
